            <h5>The concept of cookies can be traced <br>
                back to the 7th century, when <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persians" target="_blank">Persia</a> <br>
                (now known as Iran) began using sugar <br>
                in their baking. These early cookies <br>
                were much different than the version <br>
                we know and love today. In 14th century <br>
                Europe, "biscuits" started become popular. <br>
                These early cookies were somewhat similar <br>
                to what he have today, but they were harder <br>
                and crumblier. In the 17th century, sugar <br>
                become much more common and affordable in <br>
                Europe, and treats similar to cookies became <br>
                more common a well. In the 19th century, <br>
                immigrants brough their baking traditions to <br>
                America, and cookies became a staple of <br>
                North American cuisine. The word "cookie" <br>
                comes from the Dutch word "koekje" meaning <br>
                "little cake". The infamous chocolate chip <br>
                cookie we know today was accidentaly created <br>
                by Ruth Wakefield in 1938.
